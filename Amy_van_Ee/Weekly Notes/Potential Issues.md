## Chosen Issue: Scene Segmentation
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S143484112030621X?casa_token=GV1lihu5imMAAAAA:JjMDWwDSKwZ9DuAPzinxzX6azbr1g4dHBafijmVJG5S8ew7Pu2OPuGKzulcRwOHd1AaTOaBQ
  - Scene segmentation: divide an image into different component objects, partition it into parts that are semantically meaningful (for example, identify the background and foreground of an image)
    - Classify each pixel as belonging to a particular object (pixel-wise classification)
    - After dividing an image, can then analyze the parts for further decision making
      - biomedical applications of identifying anomalies in scans? (can also use for inspection in industry and automated driving)
  - CNN (convolutional neural network) very useful in this regard, able to extract features automatically without input of a human engineer using its connected convolutional layers
