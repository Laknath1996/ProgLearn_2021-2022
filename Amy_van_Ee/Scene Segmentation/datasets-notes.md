The datasets below were recommended by Jovo to become familiar with so we can test our scene segmentation algorithms.

# ImageNet

- Challenges
  - https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/index.php
- Specifically will look at ADE20K
  - http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/
  - https://github.com/CSAILVision/ADE20K
    - Provides a small subset of images without needing to register
      - Includes png files that are masks of each object
      - Includes original unaltered jpg image
      - Final segmented image with colors
      - A json file (JavaScript Object Notation) with data structures and labels
    - Also includes a Python notebook to become familiar with images
    - 

# CLEVR
(Compositional Language and Elementary Visual Reasoning)

Benchmarks
  - https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/clevr
  - Can see 3D shapes and occluded objects in scenes
