# [Notes for Figure Checklist](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/09/08/figures.html)
# Main Point
  * Pops out
  * **most important part**
  * Interesting to your audience
# Data to Ink Ratio
  * **SIMPLIFY**
  * Make it easy to digest by removing unnecesary elements
    * grids
    * extra dimensions
    * unnecessary legends
# Color
  * Consistent color pallete
    * If an algorithm is one color in a graph, it owns that color for the duration of the paper/presentation
  * Red is the thing you wanna call attention to
  * Default color gray so you can use black for emphasis
# Title
  * Provides context
  * Can provide conclusion
# Axes
  * All are labeled
  * Minimize numbers, only include if they're interesting
  * If a log axis, label it like it is
  * Should be words, not numbers or symbols so that you don't have to read caption
  * Keep axes tight unless you have a good reason for displaying more
  * Keep aspect ratio in mind
# Text
  * Keep text readable
    * Little advantage to having small text, big advantage to having legible text
    * All font sizes are the same as the caption in text
  * All characters are legible
  * Lines labeled
  * Name your method
# Caption
  * Starts with a sentence about why it's there
    * If multiple panels, one sentence for the collective message there
  * Define acronyms
  * State sample size, dimensionality, and statistical test/procedure
  * Point out interesting parts
# Lines and Markers
  * All lines a different color/line style
  * Are the lines thick enough
    * Default matlab is not
  * Keep markers differentiated
  * Justify errorbars, whether or not they're there
# Aesthetics
  * Vector graphics always
  * Always align
  * In a bar chart, does y start at 0
  * No pie charts ew
    * stacked barchart maybe?
  * Group by key comparison
  * Sufficient whitespace
# Multiple Panels
  * Remove redundant axes, labels
  * Mention each panel in caption
  * Collect captions into one figure caption
# Tables
  * Make it a figure
    * If you can't, put it in the appendix
    * Sort the rows reasonably
