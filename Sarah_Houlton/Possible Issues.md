[Notes on potentially interesting issues](https://github.com/neurodata/proglearn/issues?page=2&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)

Pulled from issues with ndd tag
Mostly just thinking out loud and pulling some potentially interesting issues for myself

# Suppress unnecessary verbose in the Jupyter notebook outputs. #471
* Easy starter one
* Should be a one line fix

# Raise warning when self.classes is an empty list for voters. #398
* Simple starter issue
* Would be good to get into the actual code and see what's happening

# Add Progressive Reinforcement Capabilities (potentially via Q-Learning) #289
* Larger issue 
* Would take more time, definitely not one to start with but maybe cool in a week or two?

# Make a Jupyter notebook clearly showing the steps in the recruitment experiment. #56
* I think this one is actually closed

# Add task-oblivious classification capability to Progressive-learners. #42
* Not a lot of discussion, but seems like it could be cool
* Would need to read the code to understand more of what this is about

# add binning capabilities #33
* Binning sounded interesting in the lecture (edit - bagging not binning in lecture)
* May already be somewhat done?

# document code according to sklearn guidelines #4
* Portions of this may be a simpler starting issue
* might require more knowledge of the code than I currently have
