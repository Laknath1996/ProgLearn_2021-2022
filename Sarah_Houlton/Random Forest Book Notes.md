[Random Forest Book Notes](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4471-4929-3)

# Chapter 1
* â€œClassification and Regression Trees (CART)" by Brieman et al is among the first works on decision trees
* Quinlan's "C4.5" is one of the most popular algorithms
* the 1990s introduced groups of learners
* Amit and Geman introduced the first combo of decision trees and ensemble methods, leading to decision forests
* Brieman introduced random forests
* Decision Forests gave rise to the Kinect

# Chapter 2
* Notation (images from decision forest book, screenshotted for ease and because these notes aren't going to be published)
