## Reinforcement Learning

estimate a predictive model for the dynamical system and then to use the fit model as if it were the true model in the optimal control problem

### Exploration-exploitation tradeoffs: Regret and PAC learning

### Interleaving exploration and exploitation

successive elimination

### Certainty equivalence for sequential decision making

### Deep reinforcement learning

using neural networks for function approximation
