[[Leo Breiman]] conjectures that Adaboost is a random forest. [[Adaboost]] made by Freund and Schapire is a deterministic algorithm that iteratively adjusts weights of inputs to correct for misclassifications in the previous classifier. In an experiment Beriman conducted, the error rate was very close to the random forest rate after running the Adaboost 75 times and the forest 250 times. If true, this would explain why Adaboost does not overfit as more trees are introduced into the ensemble. However, this conjecture does not solve how Adaboost selects favorable distributions for the weights that depend on the training set as opposed to random forest whose distribution of random vectors does not depend on the data set.
