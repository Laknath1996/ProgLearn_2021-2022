Classification involves receiving an input of data and classifying it according to another class. How a set of particular input corresponds to a class label depends on a population distribution of the data. It is impossible to know the population distribution of data, but a classifier can reach a close approximation given sufficient data. When given an input data $\mathbf{v}$, the classifier computes the probability it belongs to class $c$ as $p(c|\mathbf{v})$. Whichever class had the highest probability would be the estimated label for the data input.
