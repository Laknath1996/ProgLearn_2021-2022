Decision trees are a hierarchical tree of nodes where the output of one node serves as the input of an adjacent node dependent on the output. Each of the node serves as a function, which essentially solves for a simple problem. Thus, a decision tree computes the solution to a series of simple problems to compute the solution to a more complex one.
