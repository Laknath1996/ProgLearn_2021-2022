Weak learners constitute the split functions inside of a decision tree. Represented as a split function $h(\mathbf{v}, \boldsymbol{\theta})$ where $\mathbf{v}$ is the input to the split function and $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\boldsymbol{\phi}, \boldsymbol{\psi}, \boldsymbol{\tau})$ are the functionâ€™s parameters. These split functions when represented graphically define decision boundaries separating different classes. A decision tree has many nodes with their own weak learner models which collectively define the spaces where data points would correspond to different classes.
