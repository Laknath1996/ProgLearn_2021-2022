There is a trade-off between overfitting and confidence with regards to the maximum depth of a tree in a random forest. The deeper the tree, the confidence in the prediction also increase. However, deeper trees also overfit more, making it more sensitive to noisy training data. The choice of the optimal depth of the tree depends on the complexity of the problem.
