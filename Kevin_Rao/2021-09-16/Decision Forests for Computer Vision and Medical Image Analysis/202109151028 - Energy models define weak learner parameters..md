Energy models are functions that measure the energy or information gain when data is separated into different sets. When using this as an objective function for optimization, they influence the decisionâ€™s trees predictions.

Using the principles of entropy and information gain, one can measure the amount of uncertainty reduced by splitting the data sample $\mathcal{S}$ into different subsets  $\mathcal{S}^L$ and $\mathcal{S}^R$:
$$
I = H(\mathcal{S}) - \sum_{I \in \{L, R\}} \frac{|\mathcal{S}^i|}{\mathcal{S}}H(\mathcal{S}^i)
$$
where $H$ is the [[Entropy|entropy]] function, a measure for the uncertainty.
