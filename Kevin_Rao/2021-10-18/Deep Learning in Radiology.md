# Deep Learning in Radiology
- Deep learning attempts to mimic neurons of neocrotex to identify patterns
- Many deep learning studies fail to emphasize importance of data collection since deep learning algorithms require large amount of data
- Thousands of cases for a range of pathologies need to be collected and annotated for deep learning
- Weak supervision (bounding box instead of pixel labeling) fails for deep network building of complex data
- Felix project aims to use deep learning to improve CT and MR pancreas image interpretation.
  1. Train to identify and recognize normal pancreas in CT data 
  2. Identify range of pancreatic pathologies
- Algorithms are only as good as the data sets used to train them
  - The process of annotating images for their segmentation and features is labor intensive.
- Developing best practice guidelines and sharing data would improve research efficiency and improve availability of data.
