https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/08/31/sig-and-feas.html

**Feasibility**
- The probability that you can complete the project given your current resources/constraints.
  - resources include background knowledge, knowledge you have access to, collaborators
  - constraints include time and energy
 
**Significance**
-How important , for the world, successful completion of the project will be
  - Significance = # of people impacted x impact per person

**Intrinsic Motivation**
- The more intrinsic motivation you have the more likely you are able to complete the project excellently


## Explanatory Figures 
https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/09/08/figures.html
- **Main Point** of the figure should pop out. know what it is and who your audience is 
- **Data to Ink Ratio** remove unnecessary borders, gridlines, data markers, legends, etc 
- **Color** use a clear and consistent (within and across figures) palette
- **Title** should provide context (sample size, dimensionality,etc) and possibly conclusion
- **Axes** must be labeled with units, should be words not symbols, reasonable number of significant digits, correct aspect ratio
- **Text** all font sizes legible, fully visible, all font sizes should be the same size as the caption in the text 
- **Caption** Begin with a sentence (fragment) stating what the figure is demonstrating, define acronyms, point out interesting aspects 
- **Lines and Markers** different styles/colors, sufficiently thick lines, if error bars make sense are they there? 
- **Aesthetics** use vector graphics, alignment, sufficient whitespace 
- **Multipanel Figures** can certain axes or labels be removed? are the captions for each collected together in overall figure caption? 
- **Table** can it be converted to figure? are the rows sorted according to importance?
