## This Week
- Read [Proglearn Documentation](http://proglearn.neurodata.io)
- Work through example code from [Understanding the decision tree structure](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/tree/plot_unveil_tree_structure.html)
- Find an issue to start working on 
- Continue studying [Omnidirectional transfer for Quasilinear Lifelong Learning](https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/ProgLearn_2021-2022/blob/main/Nick-Hahn/Week_1/omnidirectional_transfer.md) and Decision Forests for Computer Vision and Medical Image Analysis
