1. Main point
- by far most important! 
- should pop-out at audience
- you must know percisely what the main point and who your audience is
2. Data to Ink Ratio
- reduce cognitive load for the audience
- while maintaining same point
- remove when you can borders, gridlines, data markers, legends (by labeling data directly), unnecessary dimensions
3. Color
- Use either, qualitative color scheme (red pops out), diverging color scheme (heatmaps), or blue and orange color scheme

- Provide context, and potentially conclusion
5. Axes
- labeled
- units
- As few #'s on axes as possible
- labels should be words, not symbols or abbreviations
- reasonable sig figs
- reasonable bounds on axes
- correct aspect ratio
6. Text
- clear font sizes
- letters and numbers fully visible
- labeled lines
7. Captions
- State what figure demonstrates
- define acronyms
- when relevant, state the sample size, dimensionality, and statistical test/procedure
- End by pointing out anything interesting
8. Lines & Markers
- different line styles and colors for different lines
- sufficient thickness
- consider errorbars
9. Aesthetics
- vector graphics preferred
- sufficient whitespace
10. Multipanel figures
