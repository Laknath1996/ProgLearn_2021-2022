Can you complete a project given:
* **Resources**: background knowledge, previous knowledge to access, resources from collaborators, and facilities.
* **Constraints**: time, energy, and competing life interests

## Significance
How important will the project be? # people impacted x impact per person. There is a balance.

## Intrinsic Motivation
