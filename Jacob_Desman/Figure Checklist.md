## Main Point
Main point should always pop out to audience.

## Data to Ink Ratio
* All data is critical to main point (cannot be removed).
* Remove unneccessary borders, gridlines, data markers, legends, and dimensions (i.e. 2D stays in 2D)

## Color
* **Qualitative color scheme** - ex. show red line to draw attention 
* **Diverging Color Scheme** - ex. heatmaps
* **Blue or orange sequential scheme** - multiple lines changing a single variable

Color use should be consistent across figures, empahsize should be used appropriately given palette, and red should represent what audience should pay attention to.

## Title
* Provides context

## Axes
* Has unit labels
* Show minimal possible numbers on x and y-axis
* Log scale should be labeled
* Appropriate significant digits
* Axis labels should be words
* Axes should be tight unless there is a good reason for excess
* Is aspect ratio correct?

## Text
* Legibile font size (i.e. same size as text)
* All letters/numbers visible
* Lines are labeled
* Method should be named and consistently used

## Caption
* Start w/ sentence fragment for entire figure
* Define all acronyms
* State sample size, dimensionality, and statistical test/procedure 
* End by pointing out interesting figure aspects

## Lines & Markers
* Is each line/dot a different style and color?
* Lines should be sufficiently thick
* Markers should be different
* Errorbars unless justified why not

## Aesthetics
* Should be vector graphics
* Ensure alignmnet
* Does y-axis start at 0?
* Can pie chart become stacked barchart (or something else)?
* If comparing approaches, group by key comparison
* Sufficient whitespace

## Multipanel Figures
* Remove redundant axes
* Caption mentions each
* Captions in overall figure caption

## Table
* Ideally use a figure instead
* Rows sorted by most important column
