# ProgLearn Issue Investigation
**Goal**: conduct a broad investgation of some of the proglearn issues which closely align with my interests

## Issues (sorted by `ndd` tag)
* [Progressive Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/neurodata/ProgLearn/issues/289): aligns with some of my past interests exploring deep reinforcement learning. Would need to do more research to address this issue.
* [Implement scene segmentation](https://github.com/neurodata/ProgLearn/issues/39): Not sure if this is a current ndd project, but I have done various segmentation projects in my own research and so I find the idea of scene segmentation within ProgLearn interesting.
* [Contrastive learning transformer for PL Network](https://github.com/neurodata/ProgLearn/issues/426)
