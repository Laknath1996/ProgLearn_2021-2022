function that can give you gaussian sim data (xor, rxor)
- can be found in kdg (generate_gaussian_parity, spec num samples, and angle)
- make xor and rxor (100 samples from each)
- how sensitive is hyppo (use fast decode)
- gradually change the angle and see how sensitive it is to the change in angle

can also pick rxor angle and change the number of samples like figure 2ciii in omni paper
how much sample you need to detect shift in distribution
we need this because whenever there is a major shift so we need to learn a new representor 
look at the pvalue 

detect the change in distribution
