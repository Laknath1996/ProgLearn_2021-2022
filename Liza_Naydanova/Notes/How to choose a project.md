## Link: https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/08/31/sig-and-feas.html

Only 3 aspects matter for choosing a project
  - **Feasibility**
    - Can you complete project given current resources and constrains. 
      - Resources
        - Background knowledge 
        - Wealth of all previous knowledge that you have access to
        - Resources that other individuals, collaborators, etc. are willing to invest on your behalf
        - Facilities (such as computing facilities for our work)
      - Constraints
        - Time
        - Energy you are willing to invest
  - **Significance**
    - How important for the world your project is
      - Equation: “# of people impacted x impact per person”

  - **Intrinsic Motivation**
    - The goal is to know yourself and estimate what activities you find motivating
      - Heuristic: how do you spend your free time?
