## Figure Checklist
# Link: https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/09/08/figures.html
1. **Main Point**
    - The main point of the figure pops out to your audience
      - Know your main point and know your audience
2. **Data to Ink Ratio**
    - No data can be removed or summarized elsewhere
      - Reduce cognitive load for the audience while still make the same point. Do this by removing unnecessary:
        - borders
        - gridlines
        - data markers,
        - legends - label data directly
        - if the data are 2D, are you displaying it in 2D? 
3. **Color**
    - Use a clear consistent color palette:
      - qualitative color scheme
      - diverging color scheme
      - blue or orange sequential color scheme
    - Color use is consistent (within and across figures)
    - Is the default color probably gray (leave black for emphasis)
    - Make red the color of the line that you want the audience to attend to most
4. **Title** 
    - The title provides context and possibly conclusion
5. **Axes**
    - All axes are labeled (with units)
    - Show the minimal possible number of numbers on the x- and y-axis
    - If it’s a log scale, the axis label says so.
    - Are the number of significant digits reasonable
    - Axis labels should be words, not symbols, not abbreviations
    - Are your axes ‘tight’? If not, do you have good reason for the excess?
    - Is the aspect ratio correct? 
6. **Text**
    - All font sizes are legible for the typical reader
      - Specifically, all fonts sizes should be the same size as the caption in the text
    - All the letters/numbers are fully visible
    - All lines are labeled with clearly different colors/styles
    - Is your method named something other than ‘proposed method’ or ‘our method’? If not, name it and use it throughout.
7. **Caption**
    - Begin with a sentence stating what the figure is demonstrating
      - If the figure consists of multiple panels, one sentence explains the collective take home message of all the panels
    - Define all acronyms used in the figure
    - When relevant, state the sample size, dimensionality, and statistical test / procedure
    - End by pointing out particularly interesting aspects of the figure that one should note
8. **Lines & Markers**
    - If there are multiple lines/dots, is each a different line style and color?
    - Are all lines sufficiently thick? 
    - Are all markers clearly different?
    - If errorbars make sense, are they there? 
9. **Aesthetics**
    - Are all graphics that can be vector graphics actually vector graphics?
    - Is anything not aligned that could be aligned?
    - If it’s a bar chart, does the y-axis start at zero (if it is a log axis, the answer is no)?
    - If it’s a pie chart, can you replace it with a stacked barchart (or something else)?
    - If you are comparing multiple approaches across multiple settings, are you grouping by the key comparison?
    - Is there sufficient whitespace?
9. **Multipanel figures**
    - Can certain axes/labels be removed because they are redundant?
    - Does the caption specifically mention each?
    - Are the captions for each collected together in the overall figure caption?
10. **Table**
    - Can it be converted to a figure? 
    - Are the rows sorted in a reasonable fashion?
