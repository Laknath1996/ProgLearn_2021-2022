## Datasets
* [CIFR](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
    * CIFR-10
    * CIFR-100

## Design
* Task division
    * Tasks are binary classification subset of dataset
    * Tasks are different datasets
* Combine unsupervised learning with supervised learning
    * Unsupervised and supervised tasks
    * Pretrain with unsupervised data
