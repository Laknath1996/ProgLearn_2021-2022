# How to Choose a Project?

The following note is based on an insightful [article](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/08/31/sig-and-feas.html) by Dr. Joshua Vogelstein. 

* The main considerations one should think about before selecting a project are, 
    * Feasibility
    * Significance
    * Intrinsic motivation/ Passion

## Feasibility

* Feasibility is determining whether you can reach the project goals given the resources and constraints you have. 

* Resources: background knowledge, previous knowledge, access to knowledge, human resources (collaborators, supervisors, mentors, peers), facilities

* Constraints: time, energy, other life interests

## Significance

* Significance is how vital the project would be for the humankind and its environment.

* project significance = No. of people impacted by the project x Impact per person

*  We each get to choose the relative balance of # of people vs impact on each person.

## Intrinsic motivation/ Passion

* Contributes to the success of thr project.

* The goal here is to really â€œknow yourself", to estimate which kinds of activities are most motivating/ interesing. 

* A good measure of this is how you spend your free time and what kinds of activities you enjoy. The things you like to read about, talk about and engage with would help you find your passion.
